Prototype-guided Knowledge Propagation with Adaptive Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification (IJCAI 2025)


Official PyTorch implementation of Prototype-guided Knowledge Propagation with Adaptive Learning (PKA), accepted at IJCAI 2025.

üîç Introduction

Lifelong Person Re-identification (LReID) aims to continually adapt ReID models to new environments while preserving previously acquired knowledge.
Most existing methods rely on exemplar memory, which raises privacy concerns and adds storage overhead.

To address these challenges, we propose PKA, a non-exemplar LReID framework with two key components:
